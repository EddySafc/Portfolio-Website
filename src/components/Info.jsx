          Im Eddy, a junior software developer based in County Durham. I have
          recently completed the Northcoders software development bootcamp, here
          I learnt the fundamentals of javascript, front-end and back-end
          development; which was then put together to create a full stack
          application. Since graduating I have developed my skills and branched
          out into learning new tech.
